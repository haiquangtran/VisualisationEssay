\section{Snow's Cholera Map}

On it, thin, tiny strokes represent deaths and circles show the locations of water pumps. The message of the map is clear: Deaths cluster around the Broad Street well, which had been poisoned by fecal matter from a sick baby (this was discovered later). John Snow not only drew the map, but he also convinced the local authorities to remove the handle of the water pump, an action that stopped the outbreak. Snow, many have said, changed medicine forever. 

Each black bar represented a death in the neighbourhood \cite{tedtalk}. As you get further away from the pump, the deaths seem to get less and less frequent. So you can see something poisonous emanating out of this pump on the map. It took awhile for the authorities. By 1896, the next outbreak that broke out, the authorities were convinced because of the map and told everybody to start boiling there water. That was the last time that London had seen a cholera outbreak since \cite{tedtalk}. 

It's possible to solve these problems, if we look at the empirical evidence such as the map. ``It's a  map of deaths that ended up creating a whole new way of life, a life that we are enjoying today." 



His work addressed an ongoing medical debate — in what is widely regarded as one of the most important early examples of epidemiology, he clearly linked cholera’s spread to water instead of air. The deaths at each address are indicated by the little horizontal lines, stacked up from the street like a pile of little corpses. Snow has made the map big enough to include the locations of the other water pumps in the vicinity, clearly showing a drop-off in cholera deaths where houses are nearer to a different pump. Visualizing his data allowed Snow to investigate abnormalities in the outbreak. He learned, for example, that the brewery and the workhouse, both near the Broad Street pump, had their own independent water sources and so escaped the outbreak largely unscathed. Edward Tufte, a godfather of information display, analyzes this map in his 1997 book, Visual Explanations. Tufte points out that as a dot map,2 Snow’s visualization is implicitly assuming that the population in the area is uniformly distributed. In other words, a house without any deaths means that the inhabitants of that house successfully avoided cholera, not that the house sits empty. But even with that shortcoming, Tufte praises the map’s usefulness. \cite{blog}


This map that changed the way the world understood cholera. It forced London to realise it needed to build a sewage system to fix itself and end cholera outbreaks. This map makes my top 5 because it was used to convince people of the need for change.


In 1854 London was gripped by cholera; many thousands were to die in the ensuing epidemic. Most doctors at the time believed that the disease was caused by foul smelling mist “miasmas” a view contested by Dr John Snow who suspected that contaminated drinking water was the cause. Snow believed that if the disease was caused by air then the incidents of disease would be evenly spread throughout the streets of London, whereas if poisoned water were the culprit, cases would cluster in locations around the source of the contamination. In order to prove his theory he drew a map of Soho marking each case of cholera with a black dot. He also marked each public water pump in the area with an “X”. By analyzing the distribution of black dots in relation to the water pumps, Snow was able to track the origin of outbreak in Soho to Broad Street. Snow immediately advised decomissioning the pump in Broad Street and very quickly the outbreaks of cholera cleared. His map is not only an important historical moment in public health, but also a breakthrough in the visual display of information. By showing abstract medical statistics within a geographic image, a pattern of illness distribution was made visible in a way that pointed to its cause. Today we call such information visualisations Graphic Information Systems (GIS for short).







Steven Johnson, in his book “The Ghost Map” about the London cholera epidemic and efforts to stop it, notes that Snow’s was not the first map to chronicle cholera outbreaks, or even this particular cholera outbreak. “Part of what made Snow’s map groundbreaking was the fact that it wedded state-of-the-art information design to a scientifically valid theory of cholera’s transmission. It was not the mapmaking technique that mattered; it was the underlying science that the map revealed,” Johnson writes. - See more at: http://data-informed.com/7-great-visualizations-history/#sthash.3H6BmjYE.dpuf


\section{The History of the Cholera Map}
In the nineteenth century, cholera was a disease that killed many thousands a year. Today, we know that cholera is caused by a bacteria - Vibrio cholerae, which has been shaped by evolution to spread itself in a devilish manner: It provokes severe vomiting and diarrhea. If its victims live very close to each other and they don't have access to adequate sanitary conditions, it is likely that the fluids they release will contaminate sources of water or food.

Until the 1860s, most scientists were convinced that cholera was caught by breathing the stinky effluuvia that emanated from foul water and soil, or from decaying wastes. This miasma "bad air" theory of disease was based on persistent correlational observations: Contagious maladies hit poor areas harder. 

John Snow hypothesised that cholera was a waterborne disease caused by a germ. He wrote academic papers to make his case, but no one listened to him. The tide shifted when a brutal outbreak in 1854, in which hundreds of Londoners perished within a few weeks, led him to produce his famous map. 


Among the earliest examples of disease mapping were
two spot maps prepared by Valentine Seaman to illustrate
the distribution of yellow fever in New York
towards the close of the eighteenth century. Shapter2, in
his History of the Cholera in Exeter in 1832 included a dot
map showing the distribution of deaths caused by
cholera. (Figure 1). \cite{howe1970some}
